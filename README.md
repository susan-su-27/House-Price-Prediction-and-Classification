House Price Prediction and Classification

Institution: Fanshawe College, Canada 
Role: Student â€“ AI & Machine Learning Program

Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, scikit-learn

Project Overview:
An academic project focused on predicting and classifying house prices using the Home Value Insights dataset from Kaggle. The project explored both regression and classification techniques to evaluate housing market trends and value predictions.

Key Responsibilities & Contributions:

Implemented and trained Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor models for price prediction.

Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE to identify the most accurate regression model.

Developed classification models using Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and MLP Classifier to categorize properties based on price segments.

Compared model accuracy using Recall, Precision, and Specificity metrics to assess classification performance.
